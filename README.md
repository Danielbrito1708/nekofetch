# philosophy
Nekofetch is made to be easy to use in a way that even a baby can build awesome staff on it without
having to worry about complicated and boring config files with lines of code that looks more like 
magic than a late habit. We know that we are just a neofetch like program that has only one 
purpose: make the terminal cool as hell. It ca not be difficult to use and customize so you can 
work more on your project instead of waste time on trying to make it work
